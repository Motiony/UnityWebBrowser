# Contributing

We will gladly accept contributions from anyone!

Contributions don't just have to be code, contributions can be good [bug reports](https://github.com/Voltstro-Studios/UnityWebBrowser/issues), good [questions/feature requests](https://github.com/Voltstro-Studios/UnityWebBrowser/discussions), or even simple updates to our docs.

But, if you do wish to contribute code wise to project, please see the [dev docs](dev/dev-guide.md) for setting up the project. Pickup a feature request or bug report, do the required changes then submit a PR to the `master` branch for review.
