# Branches

Quick info on our branching strategy.

## Master Branch

We use the `master` branch as our main development branch. If needed, branch of this while working on features.

## Release Branch

The `release` branch is where release builds will be created. It also where [VoltProjects](https://github.com/Voltstro/VoltProjects) generates the docs from.

`master` will be merged to here when a release is ready. See [publishing for more info](publishing.md).
