## Repo Setup

To setup UWB's git repo, see the [setup section](setup.md).

## Developing

When developing for UWB, it is highly recommended to develop using the `src/UnityWebBrowser.UnityProject` project provided in the repo. Other means of development will **NOT** be supported! Even if you are creating an external separate package for UWB, it is still recommended to develop using the provided project in the repo! We recommend this approach as the Unity project has all dependencies ready to go, all the tools, and proper projects setup for the code (both Engine and Core).

## Packaging
